Title: Hey, Campers

Today, destiny beckoned. Mistress fate reached down her hands from the heavens proclaiming on high, "Kyle! Draw thine eyes upon this job opening and give thanks, for it is rad as hell." And rejoice he did, for rad it 'twas.

Well, maybe mistress fate was just my friend Veronique, and maybe the heaven's clouds were actually chat bubbles. Maybe destiny beckoning was just hunger. Whatever. Our stars are aligned, I'm telling you.

She messaged:

<ul class="fb-messages fb-messages-left">
<li>(link: http://bandcamp.com/jobs/#designer)<br/>okay. call me crazy, but i think you should just apply for this job. the worst that could happen is nothing, the best that could happen is you come out of college designing for the best independent music website on the interweb. youre talented as fuck so give it a whirl, you have all the credentials you need AND you studied music. perfect fit.</li>
</ul>

To which I replied,

<ul class="fb-messages fb-messages-right">
<li>Duuuude. That looks phenom</li>
<li>Really really nice. I love Bandcamp too</li>
</ul>

trying to play cool, as one does. Reading down the list of requirements, excitement bubbled up inside me with each bullet I ticked off. It really does seem like the perfect fit. Let me explain why.

### Kyle + Bandcamp

- Music is a major part of my life. I've played piano for 16 years, I gig professionally and I understand the challenges that artists face. I majorly respect what that Bandcamp is doing to improve the music industry and I'd love to take part in that quest.
- I know the ins-and-outs of CSS, HTML, and SASS. I find it easiest to sketch my ideas on paper and then design in the browser, letting the details morph organically as I go. That said, I'm happy to flesh out comps using Sketch or Photoshop when required.
- Past, less-than-pleasant jobs have taught me the importance of working with A-list teams. I think Bandcamp is doing an admirable job in its image, voice, and execution. I can help continue that trend.
- I welcome criticism. Bring it on. We can make this thing better.
- I cheated on the email address riddle. Do I fail?

### What else?

I'm taking 21 credits and I graduate in May. I can't make any promises about hours or schedules until that point, but after my parents and professors throw me into the "real world" I'll have plenty of time. I really look forward to hearing back from you all. Let me know if you need anything else.
