Title: Tunetwin

----

Text: (link: http://tunetwin.co text: Tunetwin) is under construction, but here's the gist: do you ever hear a song in a movie or on the radio and think to yourself, *hold on... have I heard this before*? Tunetwin is for documenting and sharing these mirrored melodies. It will display entries side-by-side, offering audio excerpts, dates of composition, and commentary on historical background and potential influence.
